### Config

#### Overview

This private repository contains my current Neovim configuration scripts and potentially other configuration files for various tools and utilities. It serves as a secure and version-controlled location to keep my setups organized and up-to-date.

#### Contents

- `nvim/` - The Neovim configuration directory containing my init.lua, plugin setups, and customizations.
- Other config directories (to be added in the future) - Any additional configuration files for tools like `zsh`, `tmux`, `git`, `yaml`, etc.

#### Versioning

I use Git version control to track updates and revisions to my configuration files. Each update is tagged with a new version to track changes over time and ensure that the most current version is always accessible.

#### Usage

This repository is private and meant for personal use only. The config scripts can be copied and used as a reference, but modifications are not recommended unless you understand the configurations fully.

#### License

This repository is open-source and released under the MIT License. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute the code as you see fit, with appropriate attribution.
